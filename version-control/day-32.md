today i finished the version control module , i have to practice more i will dedicate an week or two to revise everything i have learned so far in my devops journey 

today i learned about :


- solving merge conflicts
- about .gitignore
- about git stash and git stash pop
- going back in the commit history with commit hashes
- undoing and changing commits with git revert , git -- amend , git reset hard and soft 
- git merge and merging in ui
- and lastly whats the importance of git in devops like i need to learn it for infra as code and to collaborate with devops team to manage configuration files 



- so here my version control module ends i m having very less time due to ramzan and helping my father but surely gonna practice all this well and will move ahead in the course
