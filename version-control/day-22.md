day -22 (practice git today)


Today I practiced Git and GitHub by uploading an existing Python file. I messed up the setup at first, fixed it, and finally pushed the code successfully. After 30–45 minutes, I had a much clearer understanding of how Git and GitHub work. Tomorrow, I’ll practice branches and explore more Git features.
