## Package Manager (APT)

APT is used to install, update, and remove software on Ubuntu/Debian-based systems.

### Commands practiced
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install docker.io  
sudo apt remove docker.io  

---

## Docker Installation

Installed Docker using the APT package manager.

Checked Docker version using:
docker --version

---

## Snap Package Manager

Snap is a universal package manager that works across multiple Linux distributions.
It installs applications along with their dependencies and runs them in isolation.

### Example commands
snap install docker  
snap list  
snap remove docker

## APT vs APT-GET

Both are used in Debian-based distributions.

- `apt` is newer and more user-friendly
- `apt-get` is older and commonly used in scripts

---

## Debian-based vs Red Hat–based Distributions

- **Debian-based** (Ubuntu, Debian)
  - Package format: `.deb`
  - Package manager: APT

- **Red Hat–based** (RHEL, CentOS)
  - Package format: `.rpm`
  - Package manager: YUM / DNF

---

## Notes
- APT automatically handles dependencies
- Snap packages are universal across distros
- Docker service can be managed using `systemctl`
