# Linux Basics Practice

This repository contains my Linux hands-on practice organized by day.

## Structure

- `day-1/` – Navigation and basic commands (pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, rm)
- `day-2/` – File permissions, users, and groups
- `day-3/` – Pipes and redirection
- `day-4/` – Miscellaneous commands and mini projects

Each day folder contains:
- `commands.md` – Commands practiced and notes
- `scripts.sh` – Optional shell scripts for practice

## How I use this repository

1. Practice Linux commands in the terminal.
2. Write what I practiced in `commands.md`.
3. Commit daily to maintain consistency and track progress.
4. Push to GitHub for a visual timeline of learning.

## Goal
